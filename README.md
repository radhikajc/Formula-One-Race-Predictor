Introduction

At the forefront of emerging and innovative technology with passionate skillful drivers stands Formula 1 Racing. Formula 1 racing started in 1950 with various teams developing highly advanced technology. Formula 1 car racing is arguably the most popular motorsport championship. Behind every car racing on the track, there’s a team of data scientists hard at work, crunching data from millions of sensors, measuring lap times, tire and brake temperatures, airflow and engine performance to advise drivers and constructors on their next move. The volume of data being collected provides a perfect playground for predictive analytics.

A season comprises various races ranging 19 – 20 across countries around the world. Each race is divided into three day events. The first day has two free practice sessions provided to test the circuit and tracks and ensure everything is in place with the car and for the drivers. The second day has one additional free practice and a qualifying session. Qualifying session performance decides the position the driver starts on Race day and is judged on the basis of fastest laps set in record. Third day or Race day is the main event where the position of driver decides their position in the driver and constructor championship at the end of the season.   



Problem Setting
Research and implement data mining models to predict the course of a season given the inherent unpredictability of the sport. Through the project, considerations and processes used to implement models to predict the course of the 2021 Formula 1 season were explored.

Problem Definition 
The intention of this analysis is to identify factors that successfully determine race outcomes and to apply data mining techniques to design a model which predicts race statistics for upcoming championships.
